# 05-Data-Visualization

This repository is for the Data visualization challenge for the University of Penn Data Science Bootcamo.  
It was created in collaboration with fellow classmates I worked with my peers Kiet Hoang, Mike Pointek, Patrick Dean, Katie Ballinger, Jordan Underwood, Victoria Martin-Nelson, and Sarah Schilling.
The purpose of this code was to use the different visualization techniques of PANDAS and MATPLOTLIB in python.
